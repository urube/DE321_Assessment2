# check parameters. if none, then use default config files

# if parameters exist, check what they are and what they do.

# execute the dot.exe file on the .dot

# to run this program, the user must have pip installed pylint to their env


# change terminals working directory to the one with the destination file in it

# the path to the bin folder with dot.exe for use later

# the destination file and any extras

# next step is to use something to draw the diagram from the .dot format.
# then expand and build features around, for extra functionality


# here i will try to read a file, extract the data within, and use it for the command line
