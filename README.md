# DE321_Assessment2
## The quality goal of the assessment is:

* to create a Robust system
* generates UML diagram from python3 code

### Prerequisites
Things you need to import or install to run the program
```
Pylint, Pyreverse, Plantuml, Graphviz
```

### How to run the code?
We have Command line Interface (cli) as the main runner of the program.
```
To use the python3 program run codes from **"command.py"** and follow the prompts. 
```

### How do code create Uml diagram?
* **Pylint, Pyreverse:** Creates dot file, Graphviz generates Uml diagram from dot file.
* **PlantUml:** I couldn't automate the python to dot file for Plantuml. So, i manually wrote txt dot file which Plantuml creates into Uml diagram.
